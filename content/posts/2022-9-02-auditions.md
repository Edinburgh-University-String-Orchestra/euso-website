This year's auditions are coming up soon. They will take place on 17th-18th September. You will be expected to play a piece or movement, between 2-5min long (don’t worry about it too much, though, our jury is very nice!).

If you can’t make it in person, you can also send in a video. Recordings on phones are fine, as long as it can record a video with sound. However, in-person auditions are preferred. 

Please [contact our president](mailto:euso.president@gmail.com) for details on how to sign up.
