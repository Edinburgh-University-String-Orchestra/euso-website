#### Socials

We try to have as much fun as possible outside of rehearsals! Our social secretaries ensure that we have **regular orchestra socials**. Last year these included flat crawls, meals out and our annual ceilidh at Teviot Row House.

#### Tour

One of the most exciting things EUSO offers is the chance to go on EUSO Tour after the May exams, when we visit some of Scotland's most beautiful places for days of socialising, rehearsing, and concerts. Tour is a highlight of the EUSO year as you get to play some fabulous music, make some great friends and enjoy the stunning Scottish scenery.
