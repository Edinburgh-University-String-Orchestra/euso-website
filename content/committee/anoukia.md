The Community Outreach Officer looks after our new outreach project and is involved in organising outreach events. They connect EUSO with existing and new partners in the wider Edinburgh community.

Here are a few words from Anoukia:

> Hi everyone! I’m Anoukia, a Music student and cellist, and this year’s Outreach Manager. This is my third year in EUSO and my second on the committee. Over the summer, Lyla (EUSO Treasurer) and I started busking on the Meadows in Edinburgh, which has been a lot of fun (and a good antidote for stage nerves). I look forward to meeting you all and making music together again!
