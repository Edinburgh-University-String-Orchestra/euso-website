The Social Secretary is an official source of fun! They are in charge of the orchestra's social calendar: hosting and organising potlucks, trips and social events (e.g. ceilidhs).

Here are a few words about Dan:

> Hey I’m Leila. I study Geo and Soc Anth (in my final year yikes). As I’ve had so much experience being social and meeting up with people the past 1.5years, I’m the social sec for EUSO this year. This summer I have been making burritos. HMU if you want any burrito wrapping/filling tips. Looking forward to meeting you all soon x
