The Community Outreach Officer is responsible for the organisation of
interactive projects in the wider community.

Here are a few words from Will:

> Hello! I'm Will and I'm in my 2nd year studying maths. As well as solving equations, I also love playing music - and EUSO is officially the best place to do that! I'm so excited to be taking on the orchestra's outreach work this year along with Anoukia. Our aim is that we can have lots of fun with music, whilst sharing that joy with people in the community.
