I’m Anoukia, a Music student and cellist, and this year’s Outreach Manager. This is my third year in EUSO and my second on the committee.

I look forward to meeting you all and making music together again!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/outreach/\">More about outreach</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/contact/\">Contact information</a></p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"The Community Outreach Officer looks after our new outreach project and is involved in organising outreach events.
