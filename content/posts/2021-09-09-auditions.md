For this year's auditions, you should record a piece or an excerpt of a piece or movement, between 2-5 mins long, and upload it to a Google Drive once you have signed up. The deadline for recordings will be `12pm (noon) on Friday 17th`. 

There will also be an orchestral excerpt to record to which you will access once you have signed up. Recordings on phones are fine, as long as it can record a video with sound.

Details on how to sign up will follow soon. If you have any questions until then, feel free to [contact](/contact) us.
