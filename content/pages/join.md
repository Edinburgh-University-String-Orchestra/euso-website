We welcome students from every faculty, as well as non-students.


Usually, we would be at the September EUSA Freshers' Fair at Pleasance. However, the fair is most likely not going to happen this year. We are making plans on online auditions, so [stay tuned](/newsletter/).

If you are interested in joining EUSO, please [contact](/contact/) the president about an audition.
Please include your name, instrument and playing experience, and we will arrange a time for the auditions.
<!--We will be at the

The exact location will be posted shortly before the event, so make sure to [sign up](/newsletter/) to our mailing list.
Alternatively, you can email the President for a slot.
