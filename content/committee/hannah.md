The President chairs the committee and committee meetings.
He is responsible for the conduct of EUSO and keeps everything running.

Here are a few words from Hannah:

> Hi, I’m Hannah and I’m very excited to be President of EUSO this year. I’m a fourth year music student and I play the cello. Over this summer I was so happy to be able to go to Italy to play in an opera, but of course didn’t manage to get tanned at all. I can’t wait to hopefully play some real life music again this semester!
