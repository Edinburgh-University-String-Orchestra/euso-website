We are an ensemble of around 25 string players, rehearsing every Wednesday afternoon from 2.30 - 5.30pm to work towards concerts at the end of each semester. We play a wide variety of music from Handel to Shostakovich and Strauss to Britten and we work with a range of prestigious conductors who help us maintain a very high standard. We welcome students from every faculty, as well as non-students.
