The Sponsorship and Fundraising Manager is responsible for sourcing
sponsorship and fundraising opportunities for the orchestra.

Here are a few words from Martha:

> Hey everyone! I'm Martha and I'm going into my second year studying Scandinavian Studies and Social Policy. I love all things Swedish so hit me up if you ever want to grab fika sometime! I play violin and am euso's sponsorship and fundraising manager for this year. I've recently been perfecting my barista skills so you can often find me behind the counter at söderberg servings some (hopefully) beautiful latte art:) can't wait to meet everyone and start playing some fun music!
