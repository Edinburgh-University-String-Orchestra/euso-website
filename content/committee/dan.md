The Social Secretary is an official source of fun! They are in charge of the orchestra's social calendar: hosting and organising potlucks, trips and social events (e.g. ceilidhs).

Here are a few words about Dan:

> Dan (Social Secretary/Minister of Mischief and Nonsense) is in his third year at Edinburgh studying Hedgehogs (why are they here/what do they want?). He plays, among other things, viola, wind chimes, and pebbles, with a particular interest in adding dank beats to the (already very dank) music of Brahms and Mahler. In his free time, he collects and restores socks.
