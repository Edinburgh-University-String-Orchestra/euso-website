The Publicity Manager's main duty is to promote upcoming projects, concerts and events. Lots of poster making is involved, as well as updating our social media accounts.

Here are a few words from Jenny:

> Hi! I'm Jenny, one of this year's publicity managers with Elizabeth! We're the ones behind all the posters and things you see up on our social media! ðŸ™‚ Over the summer, I've been going on adventures and taking nice photos like this one @ericjanto took of me! ðŸ˜Š
