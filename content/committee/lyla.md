The Treasurer is accountable for EUSO's finances.

Here are a few words from Lyla:

> Hi! I’m Lyla, a third year biomedical science student and your EUSO treasurer. Eric, our webmaster, coercively ornamented my head but I believe it speaks to the “flowery” thoughts we all have busking and musicking together again, especially in this summer weather. Looking forward to doing more of that with you all this year!
