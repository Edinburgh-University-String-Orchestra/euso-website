The Librarian is responsible for acquiring music for the orchestra.

Here are a few words from Nathalie:

> Hello everyone! My name is Nathalie and I'm the new EUSO librarian. I'm going into my fourth (and last ðŸ˜¢) year of my English Literature and Scottish Ethnology degree, and I can't wait for the new academic year to begin! <br> During lockdown, I may have neglected my violin a little bit in favour of learning how use a sewing machine... But totally worth it!
