The Treasurer is accountable for EUSO's finances.

Here are a few words from Lyla:

> I’m Lyla, a second year biomedical science student and EUSO treasurer. Lockdown gave me the opportunity to work on the languages I speak and discover the joys but also dangers of baking high calorie treats. Looking forward to seeing you at our rehearsals!
