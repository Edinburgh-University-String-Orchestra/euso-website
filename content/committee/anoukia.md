The Community Outreach Officer looks after our new outreach project and is involved in organising outreach events. They connect EUSO with existing and new partners in the wider Edinburgh community.

Here are a few words from Anoukia:

> Hello everyone! I'm Anoukia and I'm a second year studying music. During lockdown, I picked up my calligraphy pen for the first time in years and worked on improving my penmanship! Looking forward to playing some great music with you all!
