In light of the coronavirus outbreak and the impact on daily life and mental health, we thought it would be worth sharing some music which brings us comfort.
As such, we introduce our `#positivenotes` campaign!

We will be asking our members to share short clips of them playing music that uplifts them or brings them comfort in the hope that others will feel the same.
