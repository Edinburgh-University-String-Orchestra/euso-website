It’s audition season! Want to join EUSO? Sign up via [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebizcEWmpdBvc7sCeDUjTslz_-MRFtZhnF6nYGwqUnYgR3SQ/viewform) to receive your orchestral excerpt and the access to the Google Folder.

From there, you can send us your recordings of a piece and the orchestral excerpt.

Quality of your recording doesn’t matter, we’re just looking for a visual and audio! The deadline for submitting your audition is this Friday, 17th September, at noon.
