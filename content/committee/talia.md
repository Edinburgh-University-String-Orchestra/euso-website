The Librarian is responsible for acquiring music for the orchestra.

Here are a few words from Talia:

> My name is Talia Sanders and I’m the librarian for the coming year! I’m going into my final year studying music, with a particular focus on composition. In this orchestra I play viola- we all know how rare they are! This summer I pulled pints at my local pub and even played a few gigs!
