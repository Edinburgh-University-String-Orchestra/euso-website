The Sponsorship and Fundraising Manager is responsible for sourcing
sponsorship and fundraising opportunities for the orchestra.

Here are a few words from Elizabeth:

> Hi everyone! My name's Elizabeth, and I'll be entering my 2nd year of Law and Social Anthropology. I'm this year's fundraising and sponsorship manager, which means I'll be responsible for resourcing external funds for EUSO's projects. A hobby I've picked up is designing and making intricate layered cards with a nifty cutting machine!
